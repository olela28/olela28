  ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Linda
  
Iâ€™m all about brewing success, one cup of tea and line of code at a time!

Iâ€™m an international sales professional by day and an IT enthusiast by night. Iâ€™m currently enhancing my skills in coding and data analysis.

When Iâ€™m not analyzing data or strategizing sales, you can find me swimming, planning my next big project, or dreaming up new ways to innovate in IT.

Stay tuned for my journey, and letâ€™s connect over some tea and tech! ðŸ‘€
